            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>There is no doubt that art is as relevant to the millennial generation as it has been to generations past, if not more so. Art is more accessible than ever before, partly thanks to the explosion of Instagram-friendly contemporary art shows. As the world changes, so too must the art-world.

                Galleries can no longer rely on being exclusive and intimidating, the preserve of the wealthy, in an era where we consume art daily on our phones and are inspired to go to exhibitions by other people’s selfies.
                
                When I was a child, a trip to an art gallery meant wandering through endless huge rooms with religious paintings that all looked similar, meant nothing to me, and were equally incomprehensible to anyone without an art history degree. When I took my seven year old son to see Lee Bul at the Hayward Gallery, some thirty years later, there were sculptural costumes hanging from the ceiling, brilliant and engaging performance films, and even the ubiquitous “selfie moment”. It’s art in a glorious, exciting, colourful form which is speaking directly to the generation that consumes it at an ever-faster pace.
